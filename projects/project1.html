            <h2>About This Project</h2>
            <p>The 2DoApp is a SwiftUI-based application designed to streamline task management and productivity. Built with simplicity and functionality in mind, the app employs a tabbed interface to provide users with an intuitive and organized way to manage their daily activities. The main features of the app are encapsulated in two core sections: the Task List and the Timer, each accessible via a dedicated tab in the app’s interface.

Key Features:
1. Task List View:

This feature allows users to manage their tasks effectively. The tab is represented by a bullet list icon (list.bullet) and labeled “Tasks.” It is designed to help users create, view, and manage a comprehensive to-do list. This functionality ensures that users can prioritize their tasks, track progress, and stay on top of their daily goals.

2. Timer View:

The Timer tab, represented by a clock icon (timer), focuses on productivity enhancement by allowing users to set timers for specific tasks. This feature is particularly beneficial for implementing techniques like the Pomodoro Technique or timed work intervals, helping users maintain focus and efficiency.

User Experience:
The app’s design leverages SwiftUI’s declarative framework to create a seamless and aesthetically pleasing user experience. The TabView ensures effortless navigation between the two core features, while the use of system icons and concise labels provides clear guidance for users. The app’s lightweight structure makes it easy to use and adapt to different productivity needs.

This project demonstrates proficiency in SwiftUI and a strong understanding of creating user-friendly interfaces. By combining task management with a built-in timer, 2DoApp caters to individuals aiming to enhance their productivity through a clean and efficient tool.</p>
